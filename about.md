### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 19 y.o software problem solver, why do I called myself _software problem solver_ ? usually I create software, and solve problems in it.

I'm fncolon rebranding to bl0cknumber, why bl0cknumber? the bl**0**cknumber means the genesis of all numbers, it's my spirit to be above all and overcome all obstacles, and allow oneself to be genesis not to follow others.

Problem solver, the **0**, nice to explain about me.

I'm currently active in open sources communities updates, and contribute as much as possible, even if it's just adding a dot in the error code sample.

Currently I'm research to how about template engine works, and how to made it different from EJS, that's has a lot of tuning from another template e.g **ETA**, how do I made different template engine but require a little tuning?

I'm working as software engineer from two companies (for now) Roxi.Earth and BlockchainSpace, both are startups, I'm deep experiencing with the dynamics of startups, also I need to bring them success with all my might, sadly I'm on my notice period at Roxi.Earth for health and cost of living reason.
